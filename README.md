# Landscape
This program is developed using Python Turtle and the system draws a beautiful Landscape with mountains lake and a hut along with it.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Python turtle is a module in the Python programming language that allows for simple graphics and turtle graphics. To create a landscape using turtle, you would first import the turtle module, create a turtle object, and then use the turtle's methods to draw elements of the landscape, such as the sky, sun, clouds, hills, and grass. You can use turtle's methods like forward, backward, left, right and setposition to move the turtle to different positions and draw different shapes. You can also use turtle's methods like begin_fill and end_fill to color in the shapes you draw

You can play around with the code and turtle methods to create the landscape you want.
